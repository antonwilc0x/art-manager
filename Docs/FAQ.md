## Why is there two Art Managers?

Art Manager was originally written in Rust as a way to further understand the language. Rust is not my primary, go-to, and preferred programming language, despite how much I praise it's accomplishments. I am more grounded in C# and .NET. This rewrite is meant to continue the project using a language I'm more familiar with, even if it does have a few drawbacks.
