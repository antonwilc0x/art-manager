# Art Manager

A command line interface for storing art request, commission, and YCH information. The application is a work in progress but contribution is welcomed.

It's based on the [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) in that it provides back-end functions for front-ends to take advantage of. The benefit to this is that it's language- and platform-agnostic.

## Usage
